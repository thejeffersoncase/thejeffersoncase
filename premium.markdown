# The Jefferson Premium

The premium Jefferson Case is oh so amazing. I use mine sparingly, only when I'm going to have it in use at a nicer event or with specific groups where I have a separate notebook setaside for such occassions. 

- Hand-dyed in your color choice, or left natural. Entirely up to you. Color swatch [here](https://strathmereleather.b-cdn.net/leather%20dye%20color%20options.jpg). 
- Edges and flesh side (the inside) are burnished _smooth_ as chocolate pudding. 
- Stitched main strap, dual-layer.
- The possibilities here are endless...as seen in the "custom" section below.

## Hand-Dyed Jefferson Case

## "Custom" Jefferson Case
This is the case that my son wanted for his 11th birthday. Red dye on the outside, blue on the inside. Black strap. Fancy multi-colored buckle. **GLOW IN THE DARK** HAND-PAINTED EDGES. Quite amazing, if I may say so. 

Your custom case can be multi-color with glow in the dark edges, or not. It can use ostrich skin, stingray, etc. Possibilities here are quite endless. 

Custom pricing on this type of case, [inquire within](#purchase).
