# The Jefferson Notebook Case

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/IMG_4640.jpeg)

Crafted with precision and a nod to one of America’s most prolific writers, The Jefferson Notebook Case is more than just a protective cover—it’s a tribute to the timeless art of writing. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson, a man whose words helped shape a nation, this case is designed for those who appreciate the power of the pen (or pencil!) and the elegance of leather craftsmanship.

Whether you’re jotting down thoughts, drafting an important document, or capturing fleeting moments of inspiration, The Jefferson provides a sophisticated and durable companion for your notebook. Each case is meticulously handcrafted from premium vegetable tanned leather, embodying the same attention to detail that Jefferson himself would have admired.

## The Process

The idea for this notebook case first came from my Traveler's Notebook (passport size) and it being just too small to fit the notebooks in my ever-expanding Field Notes collection of notebooks. The concept is nothing new, is what I'm trying to say, other than that my iteration of this type of notebook case is designed to fit the standard Field Notes "pocket" notebooks (3.5" x 5.5") and their larger notebooks (4.75" x 7.5"). I made the first version using scrap oil-tan leather that I had laying around.

Once I had the initial measurements figured out, I remade the case using my standard drum-dyed vegetable tanned leather in the "tan" color with deerskin lace.

![](assets/img/product-photos/inspiration/IMG_4325.jpeg)

Moving forward with this design, I perfected it through many *many* iterations to reach the perfect sizing so that it can comfortably fit my typical carry which is comprised of the following:
- 3 notebooks (two of which are my day-to-day lists, ideas, and so on, the third being my calendar for the year).
- 2 inserts from Traveler's Notebooks: their kraft folder insert, and the "zipper" pouch.

This is the "max" configuration that I designed this for, a total of 5 "inserts", all fitting perfectly and closing comfortably with the buckle strap and then still comfortably with clipping the pencil on the outside or inside of the case.

## A Few More Photos, and most likely a few more words since I'm unable to ever help myself

I carry the "small" size of this case with me all day, either in my hand, on my work bench, at my side as I write each morning, or in my bag (which as of late is _The Franklin_). In the photo below you can see the case set open as I write on my computer in the morning with my coffee.

I have also been writing in my "day-today" notebook at the end of each day before I lay my head down to rest...capturing any final thoughts before they are lost in the dreams I hope will follow.

The "large" notebook is the focus of the photo below, this particular photo part of the "perfecting" stage of this particular size. Making sure it is cut just right to contain one notebook as well as it can then, in the future, contain up to a total of 5 "inserts" like the small size does perfectly.
